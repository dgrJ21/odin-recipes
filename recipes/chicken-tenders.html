            <li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
            <li>Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
